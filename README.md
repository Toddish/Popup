Place `/assets/css/popup.css` in `/your/css/folder/`.

Then, place `/assets/js/jquery.popup.min.js` in `/your/js/folder/`.

Add this just before your closing `body` tag, after you've included jQuery:

<script src="/your/js/folder/jquery.popup.min.js"></script>
```

```html
<a href="http://placehold.it/350x175.png" class="popup">Popup link</a>
